Our first public release of HGD is now [available](https://github.com/downloads/vext01/hgd/hgd-0.2.0.tar.gz)!

There are lots of bug fixes and feature tweaks added since the [last time we talked about HGD](http://canthack.org/2011/02/unveiling-hgd-the-hackathon-gunther-daemon/) for full details see our [changelog](https://github.com/vext01/hgd/commits/master).

The most important changes are:



	
  * SSL encryption

	
  * User Authenticaion

	
  * Many bug fixes



And this what we will be working on next:


	
  * Config Files! ([almost finished)

	
  * MPlayer slave mode from our new developer Rob Brondson ([in progress](https://github.com/reashlin/hgd))

	
  * SSL host authentication (soon)



So [grab the source](https://github.com/downloads/vext01/hgd/hgd-0.2.0.tar.gz) and give it a try!
