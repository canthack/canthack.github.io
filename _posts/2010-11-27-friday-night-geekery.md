([Republishing](http://omer.me/2010/11/friday-night-geekery/) here for the sake of continuity :))

It's ridiculously cold outside so instead of freezing on the way to the pub we decided to spend a Friday night in playing with random stuff and drinking beer.

Over the course of the night Edd hacked the [lpd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Printer_Daemon_protocol) to play music (details [here](http://canthack.org/2010/11/lpd-music-hack-how-its-done/)), Mex and Shaun helped with the 'client' and Tris wrote a front-end for it in [Lazarus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_%28software%29). I fixed my lightsaber (which you can see in the first few seconds of the video below!) and helped Hannah with the 'uglification' of her sweater which involved soldering LEDs and lots of hot glue. At some point Mex also wrote a morse code interpreter using [Plumbing](http://concurrency.cc) and Edd worked on some code to parse [ISBNdb.com](http://isbndb.com/) results. There was a brief instance where we fired up a [Cobalt Qube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_Qube) box but we got distracted and didn't do anything with it. I started putting together my LiPO powered [MintyBoost](http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/) battery pack but didn't get around to finishing it. That's a project for Hack Night #2!

Photos from the evening:


And a timelapse video, shot with a cheapo webcam hooked up to Mex's netbook. I believe he used motion to capture the frames.
