[![](http://canthack.org/uploads/wolves-227x300.jpg)](http://canthack.org/uploads/wolves.jpg)I would like to introduce WolfBot, a new IRC bot that moderates a game of Werewolf. 

Werewolf is a social game in the ilk of [Mafia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)) and has become very popular at un-conferences such as [BarCamps](http://barcamp.org/).  There are many rule variants of Werewolf, but this bot probably most closely matches the rules set out in [ultimate werewolf](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38159/ultimate-werewolf-ultimate-edition), with some changes to make it fit better to IRC, the voting system is slightly different for example. 

WolfBot is based on the popular [PircBot](http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php) Java IRC framework. It is a collabrative project between me, [Twigathy](http://www.twigathy.com/), and a number of other people. The code is avaliable on github ([tpcarlson/Werewolf](https://github.com/tpcarlson/Werewolf/network)).

WolfBot is currently playable in [#wolfbot](irc://irc.boredicons.com/%23wolfbot) on the [boredicons irc network](irc://irc.boredicons.com) and. Use the command "!join" to start playing (please note if there is a game in progress you will have to wait for it to finish before you will get voice in the channel).

_This post is a quick follow up to a talk I gave at [BarCamp Canterbury](http://www.barcampcanterbury.com/), my [original slides are available](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pnGBkSBr3OC8jpYgqtl3JOAdY01jGSvTPI22IrSMOak/edit)._
