Well it's been a long time since an update on hackery, and a lot has happened! So here goes, an attempt at covering the last 3 or so months...

I found a new hobby! Crafty but not too difficult (unlike sewing/knitting/jewellery making malarkey). I'm not very patient, and I find fiddly things too...well...fiddly! So I've found something on my level. According to Wikipedia, _"plastic fusible beads are also known as Perler Beads, or called "melty beads" by young children. These small colorful beads can be placed on a solid plastic-backed peg array to form designs and then melted together with a clothes iron; alternatively, they can be strung into necklaces or bracelets, or woven into keychains. Fusible beads come in many colors and degrees of transparency/opacity, including varieties that glow in the dark or have internal glitter; peg boards come in various shapes and several geometric patterns."_

The main thing to note here is that this is usually a hobby for children. This means that it's not fiddly (yippee!) and you don't need to be very patient (hooray!!) so it suits me down to the ground.

I started off making coasters, by copying patterns I found online and filling in the space around the pattern and making it into a square. I then began going "freestyle" and making up patterns, as well as interpreting cross-stitch patterns to make other designs. Then I came across how much 8-bit art has been made with these beads. There's an amazing amount!

I then had a go at turning my creations into necklaces, brooches and magnets, which worked well. I have since sold some of them at various craft fairs, and have plans for giant 8-bit art as well as more different types of wearable geekery :)
