Thanks to everybody who came to Digibury this week, we had a great time and we hope the people who came enjoyed the session. The slides are available below, as well as the light painting pictures you made! I am probably going to reuse the session for [TinkerSoc](http://tinkersoc.org) at some point so please leave any feedback you have in the comments with any way I can improve the talk.

As a bonus, if you use Google Docs and need to draw circuits I have a bunch of symbols avaliable for use under a Creative commons CC BY-SA 3.0 licence [here!](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1tH4V_zqeZ3aZEe9aayNFZU6nGMyJfnKfzqG1veulIwc/edit)
