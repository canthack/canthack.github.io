![](http://canthack.org/uploads/arduino-150x150.jpg)For hack #2, I started looking at how I could program an Arduino; an affordable hobby development board which uses an Atmega AVR microcontroller. More information [here](http://www.arduino.cc/).  We add a twist by not using the Arduino IDE and instead using the old faithful [text editor](http://vim.org).



## Stuff You Need







  * [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) - I was using a [Duemilanove](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDuemilanove)


  * [AVR-GCC](www.avrfreaks.net/AVRGCC)


  * [Avrdude](http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/)


  * Your favorite text editor


  * 6 x LEDs


  * 6 x 220 Ohm Resistors


  * A breadboard


  * Cables


  * USB cable


  * [C knowledge](http://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/0131103628/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1292502807&sr=1-3)



Total cost, Â£30 or so. All of the software is free and open.



## Implementation



On the web you will find the [Arduino port map](http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/PinMapping168). From here you can figure out how to hook 6 LEDs (with a resisitor each) up to port B pins 0-5.  It's pretty simple stuff, you don't need a schematic. Now we need to make those leds-a-blinken.

What I needed then was a tutorial. Google quickly lead me to [Chris Kuethe's Arduino tutorial](https://www.mainframe.cx/~ckuethe/avr-c-tutorial/). As it turns out, ckuethe is the avr-gcc maintainer for OpenBSD -- small world. By following these tutorials, you can easily get up to speed. Half an hour later and I had a "Knight Rider Emulator" using 6 LEDs:

#include <avr/io.h>
#include <util/delay.h>

int main (void)
{
	uint8_t		leds = 1;

	/* set PORTB for output*/
	DDRB = 0xFF;

	while(1) {
		for (leds = 1; leds <= (1 << 5); leds <<= 1) {
			PORTB = leds;
			_delay_ms(200);
		}
		for (leds = (1 << 4); leds >= 2; leds >>= 1) {
			PORTB = leds;
			_delay_ms(200);
		}
	}

	return 0;
}
[/sourcecode]



## Uploading with AvrDude



But how do we upload the binary onto the storage of the arduino?
This part I had already figured out the night before and it took me quite some time, partially because I did not know what baud rate the Arduino was expecting. Once I had it figured, I adapted the sample makefile found on the [arduino wiki](http://www.arduino.cc/playground/FreeBSD/CLI) -- this one is for BSD make (suffix rules work a little differently to GNU make).

## Conclusion



I was pretty impressed with how easy it really was to program an AVR on OpenBSD. The compiler is familiar - it's just GCC cross targeting, and the editor is familar -- in my case it's vim and not a bloated java GUI.

Ofcourse, this just scratches the surface. Expect further hacks later.

Thanks to ckuethe@ for his tutorial.
