Updates on the blog have been a bit thin and far between recently, but that's because a lot of us have been busy organising BarCamp Canterbury. The event was run a couple of weekends ago (Saturday 28th and Sunday 29th of April 2012) and thankfully all our preparation was worth it as the event went without a (noticeable) hitch.

I thought it would be helpful to share what we have learned, for any one else thinking of organising a BarCamp.


### Tickets





	
  * Use [EventBrite](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/), their service is brilliant, and made keeping track of people/tickets sold a piece of cake.

	
  * Oversubscribe. We have a 30% no show. If your limit is 100 people you can probably issue 120+ tickets safely.




### Food and Drink





	
  * Fifty people got through 140 pints of Ale and 40 pints of cider.

	
  * [Sainsburys do Catering!](http://www2.sainsburys.co.uk/food/delipartyplatter/platters/instore-party-platter-service.htm)

	
  * People get grumpy without coffee.




### Sponsorship





	
  * Follow up with sponsors. Some companies only replied to second email.

	
  * Make it clear what you expect from your sponsors, and what they should expect from you.

	
  * Ask for "stuff" many companies won't give money but they will hand out freebies.



I hope this helps you if your thinking of running a BarCamp or similar event yourself.  Please leave a comment if you think of anything else that would be helpful.
