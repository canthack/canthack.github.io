_Disclaimer: I know nothing.  I am learning to geek out and hack.  I do not claim to know any of the technical words, and will probably get lots wrong.  Please be patient :)_

Before:
[![the jumper before](http://canthack.org/uploads/26112010975-225x300.jpg)](http://canthack.org/uploads/26112010975.jpg)My first foray into hackery began with a very patient Omer instructing  me on the basics of circuit-making.  My plan was to uglify a jumper for  my work Christmas do, and thought that LEDs and tinsel would make happy  additions to a somewhat plain jumper.

After Omer showed me what to do by making the first one, I began by cutting a bit off each LED "leg" (told you!) and attaching a resistor to each one, to limit the current through the LED.  I then soldered these together, and applied a bit of heatshrink to keep it all together, and protect it.  I then soldered some wire to both "legs" and heatshrank (?) these using a lighter.   Repeat this 2 more times to produce a total of 4 LEDs (2 red, 2 green) to decorate my jumper with.  I then sewed some tinsel and a gaudy glittery brooch onto the jumper, and started to think about LED placement.

Omer then created a battery pack for me, and got a colour-change LED and added this to the mix!  We then placed the LEDs in my jumper, and hot-glue-gunned them in place.  Once the glue was dry, we attached the battery pack (which will use a 9v battery) and placed the LEDs in parallel, and linked them up to the battery back.[![Jumper](http://canthack.org/uploads/ledjumper-300x225.jpg)](http://canthack.org/uploads/ledjumper.jpg)

Et voila!  My first experience of soldering was complete.  I am hoping to add much more tinsel to my jumper, and more LEDs, at the next Hack Night, and also hope to attach some LEDs to a hairband to go with my jumper.  Christmas-tastic!
