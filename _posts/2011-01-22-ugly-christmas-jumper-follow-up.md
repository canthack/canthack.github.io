So the day came for the [Christmas jumper ](http://wp.me/p1dBQq-13)to be worn to my work Christmas meal, and it was very well-received by most of my colleagues.  What I had not anticipated was the need to canvass for votes prior to the meal...and when the votes were counted, I didn't place within the top 3! Understandable when you see the skill of some of the competitors' jumpers!  It was a really fun competition, and Helen was the rightful winner.

After the result was announced, lots of people did come up to me and ask about it, and when I told them the hard work that had gone into it, were amazed that I had soldered things together!!  So, next year, the plan is... BIGGER, MORE LEDs, and more promotion!!!
