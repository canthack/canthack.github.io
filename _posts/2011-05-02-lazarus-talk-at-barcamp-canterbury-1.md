This weekend just gone saw the first [Barcamp](http://barcampcanterbury.blogspot.com/) to occur in my home town of Canterbury. It went incredibly well and was greatly enjoyable.

It was my first Barcamp, and I presented one presentation on the open source Lazarus IDE, the slides of which can be found [here](http://www.slideshare.net/trislinnell/lazarus).[![](http://canthack.org/uploads/lazarus-300x200.png)](http://canthack.org/2011/05/lazarus-talk-at-barcamp-canterbury-1/lazarus/)

Big thanks to [Andy](https://twitter.com/#!/aekins) for organising the Barcamp, and I really hope it happens again next year as it was really great to meet like-minded individuals all in one place and exchange ideas and information with one another.

It was also great to see Edd win the prize for best talk for his presentation on [HGD](http://canthack.org/2011/04/hgd-0-3-0-released/).
