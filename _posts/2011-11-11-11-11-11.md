## Lest we forget


To celebrate armistice day, the last binary day for another 88 years and 51 days, and the joy of the bodge, CantHack is at it again!

We have TI hacking, watch designing, plenty of Arduinos, crafting, and software packaging. There was also beer (and Lemsip for Omer).

**PROTIP:** *Never* leave your laptop unattended at a hackathon ;)
