**Upside-down Tomato Planter**

I was reading online about upside-down tomato planters, and how particular varieties of tomato grow well in hanging baskets and the like.  We had recently finished a pot of rice, and I had kept the container just in case I could use it for something.


I drilled a couple of holes in the bottom of the container with the   biggest drill-bit I could find.  This was very difficult because the pot   kept spinning round when I tried to drill it!  I managed to wedge it  on  the ground and eventually made a tomato plant sized hole in the  bottom.

I filled the container right to the top with compost mixed with fertiliser, put the lid back on, and then pushed the tomato plant into the base of the container.  I turned it upside-down again and made sure it was completely full of compost.  I then made a hole in the lid to facilitate watering, and hung the container up by the handle.

Since taking this photo, I have wrapped a tea towel around it, and secured it with pegs in order to protect the roots from the sun, which can damage them.

Our local Oddbins was closing down, so we went in to see what bargains were to be had.  Sadly, all the booze had been sold, but I spotted these wooden port and wine boxes, going for £2 each.  We grabbed a couple and headed home, thinking about what to plant in them.

    Courgette plant







I drilled four holes in each of them, and filled them with compost.  I  have planted a courgette plant in one, and salads in the other.
