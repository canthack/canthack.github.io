A great time was had at BarCamp Canterbury 2013, held at the University of Kent, In Canterbury, on the weekend of 27th and 28th April! Around 100 attendees made it a fantastic event, with a huge range of talks, workshops and discussions. If you'd like to get a feel for the topics and activities, see our [Twitter feed](http:/www.twitter.com/barcampcant). We have been lucky enough to be featured in some brilliant write-ups, please see below for details...
